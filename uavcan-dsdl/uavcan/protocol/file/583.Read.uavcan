# Read contents of the file from remote node.
# Empty data in response means that the offset is out of file boundaries.
# Non-empty data means the end of file is not reached yet, even if the length is less than maximum.
# Thus, if the client needs to fetch the entire file, it should repeatedly call this service while increasing the
# offset, until the empty data is returned.
# If the object pointed by 'path' cannot be read (e.g. it is a directory or it does not exist), appropriate error code
# will be returned.
